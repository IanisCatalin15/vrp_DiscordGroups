Efficient Role Handling: Optimized role checking algorithms ensure efficient processing, even in servers with a large number of players and Discord roles.

Pre-Connection Role Check: Checks for Discord roles upon player connection, ensuring that players are dynamically assigned in-game groups based on their roles, enhancing access management from the moment of joining.

Debugging Tools: Includes built-in debugging tools such as printing member data to the console, facilitating troubleshooting and customization.
